Things i will need:
-persist a user session when they login or signup
-if a user is already logged in/authenticated, we will create a token in local storage (for simplicity this will be the user email and is not very secure)
-when a user logs out, local storage needs to be cleared of any tokens
-when a user logs in/registers, a local storage needs to be created with that token.
-When the page is loaded, you need to check if there is a token already on the local storage.
-If it exists with a valid account, you skip the sign in page and go to the home page
-any backend requests that require the user to be logged in when made, needs to send the token with them and verified that it is an actual account for every backend request, and have the controller verify it. 
-create a users table that has a one to many relationship with date ideas.
